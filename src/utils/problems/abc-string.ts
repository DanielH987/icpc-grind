  problemStatement: `<p class='mt-3'>
    Youâ€™re given a string consisting of the characters A, B, and C. The string contains the same count of A, B, and C characters.
  </p>
  <p class='mt-3'>
    A string is <strong>beautiful</strong> if:
    <ul class='list-disc ml-6'>
      <li>Its length is divisible by 3.</li>
      <li>The string can be split evenly into contiguous substrings of size 3, where each substring has one A, one B, and one C, in any order.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p class='mt-3'>
    For example: <code>ABCCBA</code> is a beautiful string, but <code>ABCAB</code> and <code>CCBAAB</code> are not beautiful.
  </p>
  <p class='mt-3'>
    Given a string, you want to partition it into subsequences (not necessarily contiguous) such that each subsequence is a beautiful string.
  </p>
  <p class='mt-3'>
    For example, for the string <code>ABACBCAACCB</code>, we can do the following:
  </p>
  <pre>
  AB   CA C B
    ACB  A C B
  </pre>
  <p class='mt-3'>
    This partitions the string into two subsequences <code>ABCACB</code> and <code>ACBACB</code>, both of which are beautiful.
  </p>
  <p class='mt-3'>
    Find the minimum number of subsequences you can partition the input into such that each subsequence is beautiful.
  </p>
  <p class='mt-3'>
    It can be proven that there is always at least one such partition for all possible inputs that satisfy the input constraints.
